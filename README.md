# Top-Scoring-Kaggle-Model-LANL-EQ-Prediction-4th-Place-
This repository contains a relatively simple deep learning model that would score in the top 4 of the recent Kaggle competition "LANL Earthquake Prediction". This approach does not involve ensembling, extensive feature engineering (single simple feature), or a complex network architecture, and is a fundamentally different approach than the one taken by the other top performers in this competition.

Deep learning model is a CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)
